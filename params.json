Aside from the DSCM concepts, the command line is not easy: it is aimed at people who know git.. advanced nerds, not beginners.\r\n\r\nThis project is an attempt to make the git command line a friendly place: it eases the learning process by providing guidance and high level commands.\r\n\r\n###Benefits\r\n\r\n* **g2** helps setup git settings : sshkeys, username, email & tools.\r\n* **g2** warns before any destructive operation.\r\n* **g2** provides two letter acronyms for most commands.\r\n* **g2** provides a reduced set of commands which give guidance on what to do next.\r\n* **g2** enhances command line experience with TAB completion & a smart prompt.\r\n* **g2** warns when a branch history was changed on the server (forced pushed).\r\n* **g2** checks the fresheshness of the branch prior to merging.\r\n* **g2** enforces new commands to force developers into a clean linear history.\r\n* **g2** requires a clean state before rebasing, checking out, branching or merging.\r\n* **g2** provides guidance when it cannot perform an operation.\r\n* **g2** brings a number of friendly commands such as : panic, sync, freeze, wip.\r\n* **g2** eases branch creation.\r\n\r\n###What G2 is not\r\n\r\n* A replacement for **git**. Rather, g2 is a layer on top of git\r\n* A magic way to learn GIT. It will help by providing guidance but you will still need to understand how git works.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n**PRE-REQUISITES**: \r\n\r\n* **g2** is a layer on top of git, If you are doing a manual install, a recent version of git must be pre-installed.\r\n* Please backup your favorite ~/.gitconfig as g2 with recreate it from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Linux (RedHat/Ubuntu):\r\n\r\nPlease clone the repository, edit either **/etc/bashrc**, **/etc/bash.bashrc** or **~/.bashrc** and add the following code:\r\n\r\n    [[ $PS1 && -f /path/to/g2-install.sh ]] && \\\r\n         . /path/to/g2-install.sh\r\n\r\n###MacOS:\r\n\r\nSame as Linux, make the change in `~/.bash_profile`\r\n\r\nThe software will soon be available via a [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) package, stay tuned.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Solaris (Partially tested):\r\n\r\nAdd the following script to **/etc/bashrc** or **~/.bashrc** (or any other file sourcing those).\r\n\r\n    PATH=/usr/xpg4/bin:$PATH\r\n    export PATH\r\n    [[ $PS1 && -f /path/to/g2-install.sh ]] && \\\r\n         . /path/to/g2-install.sh\r\n\r\n###Windows:\r\n\r\nGit is not a prerequisit on windows as the installer comes bundled with it.\r\n\r\nPlease download the Windows native installer from [https://github.com/downloads/orefalo/g2/Git-1.7.10.exe](https://github.com/downloads/orefalo/g2/Git-1.7.10.exe).\r\n\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n\r\nThe project introduces the `g` alias. Taken without parameters it displays the following output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ g\r\nUsage:\r\n\tabort - aborts any rebase/merge\r\n\tam <?-f> - amends last commit with staging area\r\n\tbr <?branch> - list or create branches\r\n\tbs - bisect\r\n\tco <branch> - switches branch (either local/remote)\r\n\tcp <commit> - cherry-pick\r\n\tci <?params...> - commit\r\n\tclone <url> - clone a remote repository\r\n\tdf/dt <?params...> - compares files\r\n\tfetch - synchronizes remote branches\r\n\tfreeze/unfreeze <?-m comment> <?file> - freeze/unfreeze files\r\n\tgc - garbage collects: run fsck & gc\r\n\tgp - grep\r\n\tgui - launches the GUI\r\n\tig <file> - adds to gitignore & removes from source control\r\n\tinit <folder> - init a repository\r\n\tkey <?-gen> - displays/generates your ssh public key\r\n\tmg <?params...> <branch> - merge\r\n\tmt <?params...> - fixes conflicts by opening a visual mergetool\r\n\tmv - move (rename) a file\r\n\tlg - displays commit log\r\n\tls <?params...> - list files under source control\r\n\tpanic - gets you back on HEAD, cleans all untracked files\r\n\tpull/push <?opts> <remote> <branch> - deals with other branches\r\n\trb <?params...> <branch> - rebase\r\n\trm <params...> - remove\r\n\trs <params...> - reset\r\n\trs upstream - resets branch to upstream state\r\n\trt <?params...> - remote\r\n\trv <commit> - revert\r\n\tsetup - configures user, key, editor, tools\r\n\tsh <?-deep> - show commit contents\r\n\tsm <?params...> - submodule\r\n\tst <?params...> - status\r\n\tsync - syncs working branch: fetch, rebase & push\r\n\ttg - tag\r\n\ttrack <?upstream_branch> - shows/set tracking\r\n\twip/unwip - save/restore work in progress to branch\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn top of providing two letters acronyms for most git commands, **g2** has interesting features which enhance command line experience.\r\n\r\n###Setup\r\n\r\n`g setup` and `g key` are two handy commands to setup username, email, keys, editor and tooling.\r\n\r\n![image](http://orefalo.github.com/g2/images/setup.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt anytime, you may display your ssh key with: `g key`\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git key\r\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDDYUTgzU9zjsdda9WBEED5bH+SVMq5bYoIxPSzop2IqUBoyyOlRdHt4dy2r/MWiB2eKQOQmPRE7SeawhFWYbCwEdi6BtEe8m4PiZd3OIRV13TlPj54Hi6Q1Ab8emEAH026L4kwef46+j0aJf/7tZzUw/uZW9Wrnf1VN+J1VlWvmYaG9JpPBuatAlTV9rhCeQ2WO39KYWVYJxH1mO0zPEpuTBojji7HYJtlS4OCKgY9mCVBPiUzzLfmrlIhZz+k5rMWv6i4tQtats23qtHEOi9GxJm4+TSGLwM89/C186CJ+8Yx0g/c2DIbVtPm2VMwUayu8wU4GfBHtOwin4cLWsvT orefalo@dummy.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould you need to regenerate the key pair, the process is equally user friendly: use `g key -gen`\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git key -gen\r\nRegenerate SSH Key (y/n)? y\r\nGenerating SSH keys...\r\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\r\n/Users/orefalo/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.\r\nOverwrite (y/n)? y\r\nYour identification has been saved in /Users/orefalo/.ssh/id_rsa.\r\nYour public key has been saved in /Users/orefalo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\r\nThe key fingerprint is:\r\n57:60:84:fa:0e:3b:96:12:15:2e:f3:d5:30:ce:aa:4f orefalo@yahoo.com\r\nThe key's randomart image is:\r\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\r\n|         o+      |\r\n|      . +. .     |\r\n|     . = +  .    |\r\n|    o + + ..     |\r\n|     = +S .      |\r\n|    . + ..       |\r\n|     oE=         |\r\n|    o.= .        |\r\n|     +..         |\r\n+-----------------+\r\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDDYUTgzU9zjsdda9WBEED5bH+SVMq5bYoIxPSzop2IqUBoyyOlRdHt4dy2r/MWiB2eKQOQmPRE7SeawhFWYbCwEdi6BtEe8m4PiZd3OIRV13TlPj54Hi6Q1Ab8emEAH026L4kwef46+j0aJf/7tZzUw/uZW9Wrnf1VN+J1VlWvmYaG9JpPBuatAlTV9rhCeQ2WO39KYWVYJxH1mO0zPEpuTBojji7HYJtlS4OCKgY9mCVBPiUzzLfmrlIhZz+k5rMWv6i4tQtats23qtHEOi9GxJm4+TSGLwM89/C186CJ+8Yx0g/c2DIbVtPm2VMwUayu8wU4GfBHtOwin4cLWsvT orefalo@yahoo.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Basic commands\r\n\r\nGit is often referenced as a content SCM, that freezes the state of a folder. \r\nSo rather than providing a `git add` and `git rm`, **g2** introduces the `freeze` and `unfreeze` commands.\r\n\r\nWithout arguments, `freeze` literally freezes the state of the workspace into the staging area. The content can later be committed with the `ci` command or unfrozen with `unfreeze`.\r\n\r\nFinally the most common git commands `g st` and `g lg` have been enhanced to display a nice colorized outputs.\r\n\r\n![image](http://orefalo.github.com/g2/images/lg.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Panic!\r\n\r\nIt happened to all of us. You try a new command (like a rebase) and things didn't work as expected. \"Wait a minutes, what's that blinking led light on the flight panel? Where is the manual?\". Suddenly, you feel the necessity to hunt an expert advise. Bad luck he's  either not available, there no-one to help you! \"Damn it ! I wish I never run that command!\".\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, your are Panickingâ€¦\r\n\r\nWell, here comes `g panic`\r\n\r\n\r\n`panic` checks out the last good state (HEAD) and removes all files not under source control, leaving a clean workspace to resume from. It's the easiest way to get you back on track and ready to work. No more cood sweats.\r\n\r\n###Tracking\r\n\r\nA **tracking branch** is a local branch that is connected to a remote branch. When you synchronize on that branch, it automatically pushes and pulls to the remote branch that it is connected with.\r\n\r\n**g2** provides a handy command to display and set tracking: `g track`\r\n\r\n![image](http://orefalo.github.com/g2/images/track.png)\r\n\r\nBy default, it displays the tracking table. The command accepts a parameter to set tracking for the working branch. Say you want to track local branch _devel_ with _origin/devel_.  \r\nSwitch to the devel branch and type `g track origin/devel`\r\n\r\n\r\n###Branching\r\n\r\nDisplaying the list of branches is achieved with the branch `g br` command. Note how it provides details not only about the local and remote branches, but also about the state of these branches when compared to the status on the server.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ g br\r\n  gh-pages\r\n* master\r\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master\r\n  remotes/origin/gh-pages\r\n  remotes/origin/master\r\n---\r\ngh-pages (ahead 0) | (behind 0) origin/gh-pages\r\nmaster (ahead 0) | (behind 0) origin/master\r\n```\r\n\r\nGive it a parameter and it will create a new branch. **g2** will prompt if you want to create a matching remote branch and setup tracking accordingly.\r\n\r\nUse checkout `d co` to switch to that branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ g br NEW_branch\r\n(M=6c1fc *1) orefalo@OLIVIERS-IMAC \r\n$ g br\r\n  NEW_branch\r\n  gh-pages\r\n* master\r\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master\r\n  remotes/origin/gh-pages\r\n  remotes/origin/master\r\n---\r\ngh-pages (ahead 0) | (behind 0) origin/gh-pages\r\nmaster (ahead 0) | (behind 0) origin/master\r\n$ g co NEW_branch \r\nSwitched to branch 'NEW_branch'\r\n$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with git, this is no rocket science. There is however a hidden gem which might save you headaches going forward: **g2** is extremely strict when it comes to switching branches.\r\n\r\nYou can only switch branch from a stable state. A _stable state_ means: **no modified files, no staged files**. Should you have any changes, **g2** will complain with the following message\r\n\r\n    fatal: some files were changed on this branch, either commit <ci>, <wip> or <panic>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Working with remotes\r\n\r\nBefore introducing one of the main **g2** features, let me talk about what you should **not** do.    \r\nLook at these graphs taken from various projects on github. Note how the branches overlap...\r\n\r\n![image](http://orefalo.github.com/g2/images/h2.jpg)\r\n![image](http://orefalo.github.com/g2/images/h3.jpg)\r\n\r\nLooks familiar? This is unfortunately the consequence of multiple people working on the same branch. Wouldn't it be nicer to have straight lines, with segments showing only when feature branch is merged?  In fact, git provides all the tooling to get around these ugly loops, but as you can see... few people know about it ;-/\r\n\r\nSo what's a clean history, would you ask?\r\n\r\nWith **g2** however, the graphs above are not likely to happen. **g2** enforces two different scenarios, each backed by a different command.\r\n\r\nFirst the scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. Saving your code into its working branch\r\n2. Merging features from other branches: As the project evolves other features may need to be merged in.\r\n\r\nThe matching commands are `g sync` and `g pull`, here is how to use them:\r\n\r\n* Use `g sync` to synchronize the current branch. The command doesn't take any parameters because it uses the tracking table to figure the remote/branch. To enforce a clean linear history, the changes are always appended to the end of the branch. Once completed, the changes are sent back to the server.\r\n\r\nFor the git expert, the command issues a _fetch, a rebase and a push_ with a multitude of validation in between. For instance, it will stop if the remote history was changed; also it won't push a wip commit (see below).\r\n\r\n* Use `g pull` when merging contents from a feature branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n###History changes\r\n\r\n**g2** is not permissive when it comes to switching branches, amending or rebasing.\r\n  Unless given the `-f` flag, it will block any attempts untill the workspace is in a \"clean\" state.\r\n  \r\nYou can easily get to a clean state by using `g panic`\r\n\r\n###Work in progress\r\n\r\nWhen developing, saving the _work in progress_ is common. How many times do you have to switch branch to troubleshoot another issue?\r\n\r\ngit _stash_ typically comes to the rescue in that situation. But unless you provide a well detailed comment (which nobody does!), you loose track of which branches the stash applied to.\r\n\r\nThat's why **g2** introduces `wip` and `unwip`. Two handy commands that you will learn to love. See below and note how a wip commit is created on your current branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ g st\r\n## master\r\nMM README.md\r\nM  g2-prompt.sh\r\n(M=000f0 +2 *1) orefalo@OLIVIERS-IMAC \r\n$ g wip\r\n[master 0dcbfb3] wip\r\n 2 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 13 deletions(-)\r\n(M=0dcbf) orefalo@OLIVIERS-IMAC \r\n$ g lg\r\n* 0dcbfb3 - (HEAD, master) wip (5 seconds ago) <Olivier Refalo>\r\n* 000f060 - (origin/master, origin/HEAD) fix freeze and wip (5 hours ago) <Olivier Refalo>\r\n* b44487e - adding gui & freeze -m (6 hours ago) <Olivier Refalo>\r\n* 7acd770 - documentation, removed undo (24 hours ago) <Olivier Refalo>\r\n* a248217 - first commit (3 days ago) <Olivier Refalo>\r\n* 5fa2c06 - initial commit (3 days ago) <Olivier Refalo>\r\n$ g unwip\r\nUnstaged changes after reset:\r\nM\tREADME.md\r\nM\tg2-prompt.sh\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut how good is a wip commit if it behaves just like any other commit? The point is, it's not a regular commit:\r\n\r\n* A wip commit **CANNOT** be **merged, pulled, pushed or synched**. You **cannot commit** on top of it either. It's a real \"work in progress\" that is meant to be `unwip` at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\n#List of Commands\r\n\r\n### abort\r\n\r\nAborts either a rebase or a merge.\r\n \r\n### am (?-f)\r\n\r\nAmends last commit with contents from the staging area.  \r\nWon't amend if top commit was pushed unless the `-f` flag is given.\r\n \r\n### br <?branch>\r\n\r\nDisplays the list of branches, local and remote.  \r\nCan create new branches if given a branch name.\r\n \r\n### bs / bisect\r\n\r\nOne of git best tool: `bisect`\r\n\r\n### clone (url)\r\n\r\nClones a remote repository, wires to `git clone`\r\n \r\n### co/checkout (branch)\r\n\r\nSwitches branch (either local/remote)  \r\nextremely strict - won't let you checkout if you have changes or untracked files\r\n \r\n### cp/cherry-pick (commit)\r\n\r\nCherry picks a commit from another branch, same as `git cherry-pick`\r\n \r\n### ci/commit (?params...)\r\n\r\nCommits the contents of the staging area.
